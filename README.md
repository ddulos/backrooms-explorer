# backrooms-explorer

An open-source, sandbox-style game focused on the exploration of the Backrooms.

## Project Vision
_backrooms-explorer_ (Working title) is a sandbox-like videogame about capturing the scale and mystery of the Backrooms as documented in the wiki. 

Unlike many Backgroom games and videos, It is not solely focussed on the horror aspect.
Players can freely walk around and explore different levels, encountering both enemies and friendly entities.

## Goal
The primary goal of _backrooms-explorer_ is to provide an immersive and accurate exploration experience of the Backrooms, based on the extensive documentation from the [Backrooms Wiki](https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com).
A way for 'finish' the game would be to escape the Backrooms. However it is not going to be the focus of this game.

## Design
- The game will follow the wiki as close as possible. Sometimes creativity is needed as the wiki sometimes goes on about rumors or unknowns.
- It will be a first person (not shooter per-se) game.
- When you enter a level, you will be presented with a brief description of the level, shown on a rugged mobile device. The M.E.G. Explorer Device. It will look something like this: ![docs/readme/1.png](docs/readme/1.png)
- A link to the official wiki page will be presented as well. When clicking on it, the player will be redirected to the official wiki page inside the same phone (if possible). There may be a disclaimer somewhere that this game-level is only X% accurate due to uncertainties / unfinished work.
- While the phone is active, the game is in a paused state, unless you are in an online session. This seems fair as in some levels require you to run IMMEDIATELY whenever you get into the level.
- There will be M.E.G. bases, and you can trade stuff like almond water for armor and weapons.
- There will be a narator, that will talk about some parts of the level whenever you enter it. Things like: "Bob is feeling watched..." ( or whatever the main character name is... ).

## Features

Things to keep in mind when working on this game. 
- **Non euclidian spaces**. Plenty of level have them
- **M.E.G. Bases**. With humans living in them.
- **Filters** There are levels that lets you view the world in a different vision. Such as CRT Black & White.
- **Under water** some levels require you to dive to exit, such as level 7.
- **Vehicles** In level 69 you must drive a car until you reach a tunnel, or get killed by a giant spiders leg if you step out before that.
- **Gravity changes** In Level 7 the gravity changes depending on where you are.
- **Online**: `Todo Discuss`: _( Massive scale - aka dedicated server, or local host ?. Lets at least target instances where 64 players can be in the system. We may have to deal with cheaters! )_
- **Entity 7 ( Jerry )** can occur in any level. Touching jerry will make you see him as king, or alternatively just give him sunflower seeds and he will never appear again
- **Entity 71 ( The red knight )** can occur in any level, and sometimes helps lost travelers. Specifically travelers who just entered the back rooms.
- **Level 24** You are on the moon. But there is a giant entity many many times bigger than the sun.
- **Level 75** is a cave system made out of gallium. The stuff that melts at body temperature. Tunnels will melt around you and ambient temperatures are occelating, including above melting point.
- **Fail safe** Some levels don't have exists. (documented at least) `What should happen then ?` 

## Contributing
This is a collaborative project. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to dive into the code, models or sound, and join the effort!
Please keep your contribution true to the [Backrooms Wiki](https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com).

## Technical
It depends on the following: 
- **Engine**: [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
- **Language**: GDScript


 - Server mode is starting with the argument `--server`
   - When playing in offline mode, the server is started automatically, but nobody but the player can join.

# extensions ?
- Access to join a large dedicated server full of other players.
- A home. You can build/buy a home in a M.E.G. Base. **only once!**. It will leave a permanent mark on the map ( if there is room ). Destroying your home will allow you to build it elsewhere.

# Suggestions
- Navigational mechanics:
 - Dark/blind rooms
  - Pressing Q or E will make you use your hands to touch around.
  - Stubbing an object shows a hit marker (blue/white). High is you hit your head, middle is hit your stomach, and Low is you hit your leg or feet.
  - Echo device for creating a ping to help navigating dark rooms.
 - Markers/Spraycans:
  - Make markings to show where you have been or mark down rooms to avoid.
 - Yarn string:
  - To help you return, can be cut by entities or shifting rooms.
 - Maps
  - Instead of a simple map that draws itself and shows where your are, you need to make your own and keep note yourself. (shifting rooms will not work with maps though).
- Base building:
 - (deserted) MEG outposts can be used to help survive the backrooms
 - Making base upgrades and devices to navigate the backrooms easier (use a lot of battery)
 - Fortifications??
- Upgrading and/or making devices need certain salvage
 - To balance it out your character cant carry 120kg of scrap all at once... (15kg max?)
 - Tools to help salvage/transport?
- Equipment:
 - Tools and devices you can take with you
 - Hazmat or other suits for navigating certain areas easier/safely
  - Can be tedious to crawl through certain spaces when having a hazmat suit on.
